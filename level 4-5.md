This is almost same as previous level but this time password is stored in a file inside `inhere` directory which only `human-readable`.

This means that the directory may contain other files and only one of them contains meaningful, human-readable text while the rest are binary, non-readable type.

So in this case we can use the `file` command which returns us the file type. A human readable file is mostly `ASCII Text` type or `UTF-8 Text` type.Look for a file type that has `text` in it

And we have now got the password for the next level
