In this level we need find password for level 4 which is stored in a hidden file inside `inhere` directory.
Files starting with "." are considered hidden files by linux, it was designed to hide configuration files or System Files
from normal view.

So just by using `ls` command Command-shell wont show hidden files, for that we use `ls -a` where `-a` tells the Linux command-shell to list all files including the ones starting wiht `.`.
