This level teaches you `Brute Forcing` its a hacking method where we try every possible combination or probabilities till we get the right one...its well you can guess..inefficient,time consuming and also can be easily blocked...so not effective
<br>

So in this level we have to provide password for current level and the correct 4 digit combination to port 30002  which will return our password and theres no way other than going with all possible 4 digit combinations

lets just try to manually sent a combination and see how the setup works

OK so we need a result that is not "Wrong" and we need to go through the number combination, we use the `for loop` method which will automatically go through each combination and also combine with `grep` to return answers that is not "Wrong"
