Base64 is an encoding scheme, not encryption. It converts binary or raw data into readable ASCII characters (letters, numbers, +, /, and =) so the data can be safely stored or transmitted as text.

Since the data is encoded, what we see is not the actual password, but an encoded representation of it.To get the original content back, we need to decode it using `base64 -d` command.
