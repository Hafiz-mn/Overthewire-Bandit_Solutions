Clone the repo

now you can explore commits and branches (if there are any) and you will come up with NOTHING!!!

here comes another concept of `git`  which is `tag`...tag is something that you use to mark something important...maybe a important commit or a version of  a release like `v1.0`,`v1.2` etc..
