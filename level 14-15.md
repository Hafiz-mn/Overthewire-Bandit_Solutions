The next password is returned by a service running on the same server at port 30000, and it expects the current password as input.

In this situation we can use `netcat`, `netcat` is a command-line tool used to send data to and receive data from a network service using a specific port.

This command sends the current password to the local server on port 30000, and netcat prints back the response, which is the next password.
