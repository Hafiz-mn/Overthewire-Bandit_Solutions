This level is a bit different, here the password only occur once in the data.txt file, meaning there is no duplicate ones.

We can use `sort` to arrange the contents in order.

After scrolling a little bit i have found the password

But thats not the smart way.

By combining `sort` and `uniq` tool we can obtain non-duplicate lines.
