Another git repository that we have to clone

Here unlike last time, passwords arent leaked in `commits`, So dont bother checking the commits, well first step to learning is `exploration` so dont mind what i just said before

here we come across another important concept of git that is `branches`

a git branch is seperate line of code that we can do anything with it that doesnt affect the main code, its like `my own version of the project that i can experiment`.

with the command `git branch` you can list existing branches...with `-a` you can list hidden and deleted branches

all you need to do is explore each branch using `git switch` or `checkout` and find one which leaks the password.
