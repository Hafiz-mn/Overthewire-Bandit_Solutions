In Linux shell, spaces are used to seperate different command arguments, so when a filename contains spaces like `my file.txt`,the shell interprets it as two separate arguments: `my` and `file.txt`.

To deal with this filenames we need to tell the shell to treat the entire filename as one arguement by using double quotas `" "`.
