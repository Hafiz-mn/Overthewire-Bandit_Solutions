Ok now we have reached the `git` , First you need to know what `git` is

Git is a tool that helps you track changes in files over time. That’s the core idea. Nothing more complicated than that.

It keeps a history of your files, Lets you go back to any earlier state, Shows what changed, when, and by whom, Allows multiple people to work on the same project safely, Think of `Git` as `“save points for your project”`.

now we can store git projects in remote websites like `github`, `gitlab` etc...  where you can upload  and share the project files with other members,

I EXPLAINED IT BECAUSE IT'S A USEFUL AND IMPORTANT TOOL TO KNOW!!!! ALMOST EVERY COMPANIES USES GIT , ITS BEST TO LEARN HOW TO USE IT!!!

In the above image you can see that we have cloned the repo using `git clone`, but you should also note that the port used here is `2220`(i have mentioned the port in the link).

THE REASON YOU GOT THE FILE IS BECAUSE IT WAS UPLOADED IN THAT REPOSITORY!!!!

and there it is the PASSWORD!!!!
